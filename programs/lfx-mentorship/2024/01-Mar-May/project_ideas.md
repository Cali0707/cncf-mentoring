### Knative Eventing

#### Cross Namespace Event Links

- Description: One of the most requested features in Knative Eventing over the past few years has been for triggers in different namespaces than brokers, and for subscriptions
  in different namespaces than channels. More information can be found in the upstream issue.
- Expected Outcome: Knative Eventing Triggers and Subscriptions can reference Brokers or Channels in a namespace different from their own if the user possesses the necessary
  permissions to do so.
- Recommended Skills: Go, Kubernetes
