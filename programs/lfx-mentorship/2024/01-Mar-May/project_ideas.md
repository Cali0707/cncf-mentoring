## Proposed Project ideas

### Knative 

#### Contributor Journey Research

- Description: Getting new contributors onboarded into a complex project like Knative is a lot of work for both the new contributors and for the maintainers. This is compounded
  by the fact that many contributors don't stick around after the first few contributions. We would like to perform a research study into why some contributors stay while others
  leave the community after a bit, and determine where we can improve the contributor experience.
- Expected Outcome: Create a report based off of user research detailing the current contributor journey within Knative and highlighting areas where that can be improved.
- Recommended Skills: User Research, Communication
