## Proposed Project ideas

### Knative Eventing

#### Cross Namespace Event Links

- Description: One of the most requested features in Knative Eventing over the past few years has been for triggers in different namespaces than brokers, and for subscriptions
  in different namespaces than channels. We recently completed a Proof of Concept for how to handle this properly with RBAC, and want your help building the rest of the feature,
  across both the control plane and data plane of Knative Eventing.
- Expected Outcome: By the end of the project, we expect to release Knative Eventing with experimental Alpha support for cross namespace event links, with support for triggers
  and subscriptions.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, Bash, Knowledge of Kubernetes
